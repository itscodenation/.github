### Keywords to Search for Repositories
<br>

As our available repositories grow, the harder some can be to find! Below are some tips for searching - some repositories may not use every format section in their name, but most do. 

<br>

**The repositories follow this naming format:**
<br>
<br>format sections: [program type]-[topic]-[start and end year]-[repo type]
<br>example: int-trivia-22-23-starter

<br>
<br>

**Use these keywords to help you find what you're looking for üòä:**
<br>
| program type | topic | start year and end year | repo type |
| ------------ | ----- | ----------------------- | --------- |
| int, flw, flw1, flw2 | html, css, js, jquery, react, calculator, jeopardy, portfolio, trivia, lyrics | 14-15, 15-16, 16-17, 17-18, 18-19, 19-20, 20-21, 21-22, 22-23, 23-24 | project, starter, solution, exercise |
